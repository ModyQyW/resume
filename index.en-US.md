### Open Source

Only some of my open source activities are listed here, check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/ModyQyW) for more.

#### [fabric](https://github.com/ModyQyW/fabric)

This is an out-of-the-box shared specification for different JavaScript / TypeScript projects, including ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, LintStaged, etc., which directly improves the specification of personal and corporate projects.

#### [vite-plugin-stylelint](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-stylelint)

Vite Stylelint plugin, like stylelint-webpack-plugin. As of 2023-07-05, there are 14k weekly downloads. Based on experience with this plugin, I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker/pull/158) to [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker) to support running Stylelint.

#### [tailwind-extensions](https://github.com/ModyQyW/tailwind-extensions)

tailwind-extensions is a library that extends TailwindCSS. It provides more configurable values to reduce the use of inferred values and increase flexibility. In addition, it provides presets for use with AntDesign and ElementPlus, making TailwindCSS easier to integrate with these UI libraries.

#### [element-plus](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus)

I submitted a [PR](https://github.com/element-plus/element-plus/pull/12549) for element-plus that optimizes the `FormRules` type. This PR allows `FormRules` to accept generics and improves type safety.

### Expectations

- Work-life balance and weekends off every week
- Unified team goals, standardized processes

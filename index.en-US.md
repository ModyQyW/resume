## Projects

This is only a partial list of projects, check out GitHub for more.

### [fabric](https://github.com/ModyQyW/fabric)

Opinionated shareable specification for different JavaScript/TypeScript projects，including Git,EditorConfig, tsconfig, Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, Markdownlint, Commitlint, Conmitizen, Publint, LintStaged, Husky, VScode.

### [vite-plugin-eslint2](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-eslint2)

Vite ESLint plugin, like eslint-webpack-plugin. Initially forked to maintain and add new features because vite-plugin-eslint maintenance was not active enough.

Although I still maintain it, I don't recommend to use it anymore.

### [vite-plugin-stylelint](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-stylelint)

Vite Stylelint plugin, like stylelint-webpack-plugin. As of 2023-04-10, there are 10k weekly downloads.

Although I still maintain it, I don't recommend to use it anymore.

### uni-helper

uni-helper was originally just a [personal project](https://github.com/ModyQyW/uni-helper), but has now become an [unofficial non-profit organization](https://github.com/uni-helper).

uni-helper provides a number of packages that enhance the development experience of the uni-app family of products, some of which I'm trying to maintain, including [TypeScript type definitions](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=types& type=all&language=&sort=), [VSCode plugins](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=vscode&type=all&language=&sort=), and more.

As of 2023-04-10, there are 146k cumulative downloads of the VSCode plugin, and I believe that most uni-app developers using VSCode have used or are using the VSCode plugin and TypeScript type definitions I developed.

### [tailwind-extensions](https://github.com/ModyQyW/tailwind-extensions)

tailwind-extensions is a library that extends [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It provides more configuration values to reduce the use of inferred values, which brings tailwindcss one step closer to [unocss](https://github.com/unocss/unocss).

In addition, it provides presets for use with [antd](https://ant.design/), [antdv](https://antdv.com/), [element-plus](https://element-plus.org/), making tailwindcss easier to integrate with these UI libraries.

It also provides miniprogream and easy presets to make tailwindcss more friendly to the Chinese ecosystem.

## Expectations

- Emphasis on efficiency, rejection of red tape, any communication should be straight to the point
- China time zone, can schedule some time to coordinate meetings
- Full-time remote work, 15 - 20k CNY, social security, 35 - 40 hours per week, 18 - 24k if I need to handle my social security, tax, etc.
- Part-time remote job, 1h 120 - 240 CNY, 1h 144 - 288 if I need to handle my social security, tax, etc.

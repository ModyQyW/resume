## Introduction
I began learning front-end development on my own in 2018 and graduated from Sun Yat-sen University with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering in June 2019.

As a front-end engineer, I have a solid programming foundation, strict coding standards, and rich project experience. I am proficient in front-end technologies such as native JavaScript/TypeScript, Vue, and React, and can independently complete front-end development projects while collaborating with team members to complete complex projects.

Throughout my career, I have participated in the development of various projects in fields such as catering, education, business, and Web 3. In these projects, I have taken on different roles, including front-end development, full-stack development, and front-end team leader. Through these experiences, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge and familiarity with the project development process and requirements. I have high quality standards for code and am skilled in using various tools and techniques to improve code maintainability and readability.

Outside of work, I also research and apply open-source technologies. I have multiple open-source projects on Github and regularly publish technical blogs and articles on my personal website. I believe in the power of open-source technology and sharing and communication to continuously improve my own technical skills.

As a front-end engineer, I enjoy working with product managers to improve project user experience and performance. I also pay attention to project stability and usability and am able to use various tools and techniques to ensure project quality and stability. In the future, I hope to become a 10x full-stack engineer with TypeScript-based, product, operational, and thinking capabilities.

## Projects

This is only a partial list of projects, check out GitHub for more.

### [fabric](https://github.com/ModyQyW/fabric)

Opinionated shareable specification for different JavaScript/TypeScript projects，including Git,EditorConfig, tsconfig, Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, Markdownlint, Commitlint, Conmitizen, Publint, LintStaged, Husky, SimpleGitHooks, VScode.

### [vite-plugin-eslint2](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-eslint2)

Vite ESLint plugin, like eslint-webpack-plugin. Initially forked to maintain and add new features because vite-plugin-eslint maintenance was not active enough. I submit a [PR](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker/pull/158) for [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker) based on this plugin.

Although I still maintain it, I don't recommend to use it anymore.

### [vite-plugin-stylelint](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-stylelint)

Vite Stylelint plugin, like stylelint-webpack-plugin. As of 2023-04-10, there are 10k weekly downloads.

Although I still maintain it, I don't recommend to use it anymore.

### uni-helper

uni-helper was originally just a [personal project](https://github.com/ModyQyW/uni-helper), but has now become an [unofficial non-profit organization](https://github.com/uni-helper).

uni-helper provides a number of packages that enhance the development experience of the uni-app family of products, some of which I'm trying to maintain, including [TypeScript type definitions](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=types&type=all&language=&sort=), [VSCode plugins](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=vscode&type=all&language=&sort=).

As of 2023-06-09, there are 177k cumulative downloads of the VSCode plugin, and I believe that most uni-app developers using VSCode have used or are using the VSCode plugin and TypeScript type definitions I developed.

### [tailwind-extensions](https://github.com/ModyQyW/tailwind-extensions)

tailwind-extensions is a library that extends TailwindCSS.

It provides more configuration values to reduce the use of inferred values, which brings TailwindCSS one step closer to UnoCSS.

In addition, it provides presets for use with AntDesign and ElementPlus, making tailwindcss easier to integrate with these UI libraries.It also provides miniprogream and easy presets to make tailwindcss more friendly to the Chinese ecosystem.

I also participated in the development of [unocss-preset-antd](https://github.com/Dunqing/unocss-preset-antd) and [unocss-preset-element-plus](https://github.com/ModyQyW/unocss-preset-element-plus).
.

## Expectations

- The company has good prospects and there is room for advancement.
- The team is harmonious and friendly, with unified goals, standardized processes, and a focus on efficiency. We reject unnecessary formalities and overtime culture.
- We are in the China time zone and can arrange fixed meeting times for coordination.

## Projects

This is only a partial list of projects, check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/ModyQyW) for more.

### [fabric](https://github.com/ModyQyW/fabric)

This is an out-of-the-box shared specification for different JavaScript / TypeScript projects, including personal configuration and use of a large number of common tools.

### [vite-plugin-eslint2](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-eslint2)

Vite ESLint plugin, like eslint-webpack-plugin. Initially forked to maintain and add new features because vite-plugin-eslint maintenance was not active enough.

### [vite-plugin-stylelint](https://github.com/ModyQyW/vite-plugin-stylelint)

Vite Stylelint plugin, like stylelint-webpack-plugin. As of 2023-07-05, there are 14k weekly downloads. I submit a [PR](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker/pull/158) for [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker) based on this plugin.

### uni-helper

uni-helper was originally just a [personal project](https://github.com/ModyQyW/uni-helper), but has now become an [unofficial non-profit organization](https://github.com/uni-helper).

uni-helper provides a number of packages that enhance the development experience of the uni-app family of products, some of which I'm trying to maintain, including [TypeScript type definitions](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=types&type=all&language=&sort=), [VSCode plugins](https://github.com/orgs/uni-helper/repositories?q=vscode&type=all&language=&sort=). As of 2023-07-05, there are 188k cumulative downloads of the VSCode plugin.

### [tailwind-extensions](https://github.com/ModyQyW/tailwind-extensions)

tailwind-extensions is a library that extends TailwindCSS. It provides more configuration values to reduce the use of inferred values, which brings TailwindCSS one step closer to UnoCSS.

In addition, it provides presets for use with AntDesign and ElementPlus, making tailwindcss easier to integrate with these UI libraries. It also provides miniprogream and easy presets to make tailwindcss more friendly to the Chinese ecosystem.
